# ARTD475 Programming: Assignment05
###Recursion

**Due: 03/25/2024, 11:59pm**

- We learned about recursion, where a function calls itself, and saw an example of this in *Example 13.8*. 
- We also saw that it is important that there is an exit condition.  That is, we want the function to call itself, perhaps multiple times. But under certain conditions ( r<10 for example) the function should just return, without calling itself.  Otherwise, it could result in an infinite loop, where the function never returns.

For this assignment, create a dynamic design using a recursive function.  In order to make it dynamic, you will need to pass the function some variable that changes over time.  Consider using one of the recent concepts that we learned, such as oscillation using the _**sin()**_ or _**cos()**_ function, or Perlin Noise using the _**noise()**_ function.  (Refer to the code from _Lesson06 part1_ ) Or perhaps some sort of user input.  It doe not need to be limited to black and white, you could include color as well as shape in your design.
