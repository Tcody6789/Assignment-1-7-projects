# ARTD475 Programming: Assignment02
 
### Variables, Conditionals, and Loops 

**Due: 02/21/2024, 11:59pm**

 
- Step 1. Take your Assignment01 design (feel free to expand it, or create a new design) and rewrite it with variables instead of hard-coded values. Consider using a for loop in the creation of your design.
- Step 2. Write a series of assignment operations that alter the values of those variables and make the design dynamic. You might also use system variables, such as width, height, mouseX, and mouseY. If your main "character" is tied to the mouse, consider adding additional elements that move around the scene, independent of the mouse.
- Step 3. Using conditional statements, alter the behavior of your design based on certain conditions. What happens if it touches the edge of the screen, or if it grows to a certain size? What happens if you move the mouse over elements in your design?
