### Interactive Sketch
 
 - Design a static screen drawing using RGB color and primitive shapes.
- Make the static screen drawing dynamic by having it interact with the mouse. This might include shapes following the mouse, changing their size according to the mouse, changing their color according to the mouse, etc. 
- (Optional) Alter behavior based on mouse button or keyboard key presses.
- Add comments to your code, including a section at the top which explains what interactions your sketch has enabled.
