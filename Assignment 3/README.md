### Functions and Object/Classes 

**Due: 03/04/2024, 11:59pm**

- Step 1.  Take your Assignment02 and reorganize the code using functions.
- Step 2.  Reorganize the code one step further using a class and an object variable
- Step 3.  Add arguments to the Constructor of your class and try making two or three objects with different variables.
  - You can either keep your class code in the main sketch.js file, or move it off into its own file. If you move it into a separate file, don't forget to add that file to the index.html file.
