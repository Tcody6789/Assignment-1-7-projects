###Video Mirror

**Due: 04/15/2024, 11:59pm**

Develop a software mirror that incorporates computer vision techniques. Follow these steps.

- **Step 1.**  Design a pattern with no color. This could be a static pattern (such as a mosaic) or a moving one (such as the “scribbler” example) or a combination.
- **Step 2.**  Color that pattern according to a static image.
- **Step 3.**  Replace the static image with images from a live camera (or recorded movie).
- **Step 4.**  Using computer vision techniques, alter the behavior of the patterns’ elements according to the properties of the image. For example, perhaps brighter pixels cause shapes to spin or pixels that change a lot cause shapes to fly off the screen, and so on.
